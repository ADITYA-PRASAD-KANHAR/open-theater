            CHILDHOOD DREAM OF PREVIOUS ERA
            This is the place where every teenagers of the nineties were must have shown his face . Back to 35 years ,
            the Esplanade area was not at all like it nowadays . not so much over crowded .
            There were only single screen movie halls . The idea of the Multiplexes does not exists at that time .
            At that point of time the were so many cinema halls in this particular area of the city . Lighthouse , New
            Empire Globe , Tiger , Elite , Paradise , Orient are some of them . At that time if anybody are keen to see
            the best of the Hollywood movies , New Empire caters all of them .
            You don't believe the ticket prices at that time , Its Rs. 2 INR in pre -nineties era .
            Hundred of young stars and other people are locked themselves inside a tunnel like pavement made of iron to
            grab a ticket at that price and they have to pass through a hundred stairs to find themselves in the top
            floor of the New Empire Cinema hall , wooden chairs filled up with viewers .
            Their excitement touches the roof as soon as the movie starts.
            All the greatest movies of all time were released in this hall . I have seen almost hundred movies there .
            Those were the days .which will never return .
            Of course there were normal tickets as well .But there was always a demand for those wooden chair tickets .
            Maybe the price of the ticket and the ease of smoking may be one great causes of that rush .
            This facility is not available right now in New Empire Cinema Hall .

            Nice and nostalgic
            I have visited New Empire for many many times. Once upon a time it was my favourite hot spot to move into.
            Still feel that nostalgia whenever I visit the place
